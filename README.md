IMAGE CAPTURING USING PYTHON
Combine computer vision and natural language processing to buildan image captioning AI. Use pre-trained image recognition models
like VGG or ResNet to extract features from images, and then use arecurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based model to
generate captions for those images.
